# Netflix Dataset Analysis (By use python- Jupyter Notebook)

## Description of the project 
Netflix is a popular streaming platform that provides a vast catalog of Movies, TV Shows, and original content across various genres and countries. This project analyzes a dataset containing details of Netflix content added between 2008 and 2021. Notably, while the data reflects additions from 2008 onwards, the oldest content in the catalog dates back to 1925, and the newest content is from 2021. The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary focus of the analysis was to uncover trends, distributions, and insights related to content type, release and addition patterns, duration, genres, ratings, and more.

## Dataset used
Dataset = "https://github.com/SubhankarMukherjee-portfolio/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/netflix1.csv?plain=1"

## Objectives of the project 
 1) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix content
 2) Understand patterns in content type, ratings, durations, release trends, and more
 3) Visualize findings using Python and data visualization libraries

11) What are the top 15 most popular genres or categories for Netflix TV Shows?
12) Who are the top directors producing the most Netflix TV Shows?
13) Who are the top directors producing the most Netflix Movies?
14) What is the average movie duration by content rating?
15) What is the average TV show duration by content rating?
16) What are the most common words used in Netflix Movie titles (Word Cloud)?
17) What are the most common words used in Netflix TV Show titles (Word Cloud)?
18) What is the relationship between movie duration and release year?
19) What is the relationship between TV show duration and release year?

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used during the data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and analysis phases:
1) NumPy – for numerical operations
2) Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
3) Matplotlib – for data visualization (basic plotting)
4) Seaborn – for advanced and statistical visualizations
5) Scikit-learn (sklearn) – for basic machine learning operations and metrics
6) WordCloud – to visualize the most frequent words in titles

## Final Observations & Storyline
1) Netflix’s content library is heavily skewed toward Movies, which make up nearly 70% of all titles, while TV Shows account for the remaining 30%. Among all content, TV-MA emerges as the most common rating, suggesting a preference for mature themes, followed by TV-14 and TV-PG.
2) When analyzing durations, Netflix Movies typically run around 98–100 minutes, though some stretch up to 312 minutes. TV Shows, on the other hand, are mostly short-form, with a median duration of just 1 season, though a few span up to 17 seasons.
3) From a historical perspective, Netflix saw a surge in new content releases between 2016 and 2021, with the USA dominating production in both Movies and TV Shows. India and the UK also lead in Movies, while Pakistan ranks surprisingly high for TV Shows. On a monthly cycle, Movie additions peak in July and April, while TV Shows spike in December and July, reflecting seasonal content strategies.
4) Genre-wise, Dramas, International Films, Documentaries, and Stand-Up Comedy dominate the Movie catalog, while Kids' TV, International TV, Dramas, and Crime Shows lead in the TV domain. Common title themes for Movies include Christmas, Love, and Life, while World, Girl, and Love are frequent in TV titles.
Looking at key contributors, Alastair Fothergill leads as the top director for TV Shows, while Rajiv Chilaka tops the Movie director list. Interestingly, NC-17-rated movies have the longest average durations, while TV-17-rated shows run the longest on average.
5) Finally, over time, there’s a clear upward trend in the duration of both Movies (post-2000) and TV Shows (post-2010), reflecting Netflix’s shift toward longer, more in-depth storytelling as viewer demand evolves.
